You can achieve this using GitHub Actions to trigger a workflow either from a repository change or an external event. The workflow will:
Iterate through all PHP files in the repository.
Execute each PHP file, capturing its output.
Calculate the MD5 hash of the generated output.
Compare the MD5 hash against the corresponding file in Google Cloud Storage.
1. GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a `.github/workflows/run_php.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Run PHP Scripts & Deploy to Google Cloud Store

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [external-trigger]

jobs:
  process_php_files:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set Up PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: '8.1'

    - name: Execute PHP Files & Capture Output
      run: |
        mkdir output
        for file in $(find . -name "*.php"); do
          php "$file" > "output/$(basename "$file" .php).html"
        done

    - name: Calculate MD5 Hashes
      run: |
        for file in output/*.html; do
          md5sum "$file" >> md5_hashes.txt
        done

    - name: Authenticate Google Cloud
      uses: google-github-actions/auth@v1
      with:
        credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS }}

    - name: Compare MD5 Hashes with Google Cloud Storage
      run: |
        for file in output/*.html; do
          filename=$(basename "$file")
          remote_md5=$(gsutil hash gs://your-bucket-name/$filename | grep "MD5" | awk '{print $3}')
          local_md5=$(md5sum "$file" | awk '{print $1}')
          if [ "$local_md5" != "$remote_md5" ]; then
            echo "Mismatch detected for $filename"
          else
            echo "$filename is up to date"
          fi
        done
```

2. Explanation
✅ Triggers on repository changes or external events (repository_dispatch). ✅ Iterates through all PHP files, executes them, and saves the output as .html. ✅ Calculates MD5 hashes for each generated file. ✅ Compares MD5 hashes against files stored in Google Cloud Storage. ✅ Detects mismatches and logs differences.
